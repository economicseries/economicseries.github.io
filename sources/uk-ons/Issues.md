## Issues 

### Observations

[Observations](https://developer.ons.gov.uk/observations/)

#### Wildcard Example

```
/datasets/cpih01/editions/time-series/versions/6/observations?time=*&aggregate=cpih1dim1A0&geography=K02000001
```

- Time dimension should use label (Time) rather than id (time)

### Unit of measure

- Sometimes in dataset, sometimes in dimension
